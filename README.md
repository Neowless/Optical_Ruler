# Length Measurement with Direction (Optical Ruler) 带方向的长度测量（光学标尺）

## Introduction

The positioning of certain engineering systems is required to very great accuracy, notably in the semiconductor industry where wafers must be moved to known positions to sub-micron precision. In principle, optics should be able to provide position information to within a fraction of a wavelength of light. It is possible to construct such systems interferometrically. Simplistically, one can conceive of a Michelson interferometer with one mirror attached to the moving object and a second acting as a reference; and a distance moved would translate into a number of fringes that could be counted electronically. An alternative approach, an encoder, works as you yourself would by reading the marks on a scale or ruler. In either case the trick is to be able to deduce the direction as well as magnitude of the movement and for this you might need two interference patterns or scales in parallel. Many commercial systems (for instance as used in the Moller-Wedel experiment) use this second sort of method and can do so very accurately over large distances. 
某些工程系统的定位要求非常精确，特别是在半导体行业，必须将晶圆移动到已知的位置，达到亚微米的精度。原则上，光学应该能够提供定位信息，使其达到光的几分之一波长的范围。以干涉测量法构建这样的系统是可能的。简单地说，我们可以设想一个迈克尔逊干涉仪，其中一面镜子连接到移动的物体上，另一面作为参考；移动的距离将转化为可以用电子方式计算的一些条纹。另一种方法，即编码器，就像你自己通过阅读刻度或尺子上的标记来工作。在这两种情况下，关键是要能够推断出运动的方向和幅度，为此你可能需要两个平行的干涉图案或刻度。许多商业系统（例如在莫勒-韦德尔实验中使用的系统）使用第二种方法，并且可以在大的距离上非常准确地做到这一点。

## Aim
To produce an optical system capable of detecting motions over a few cm and giving directional as well as distance information. The system must be insensitive to tilts of the moving object, and to beam divergence over the operating distance. Limitations in terms of signal to noise ratio, maximum distance of operation, etc. must be determined.
目的：制作一个能够检测几厘米以上的运动并提供方向和距离信息的光学系统。该系统必须对运动物体的倾斜不敏感，并对工作距离内的光束发散不敏感。必须确定在信噪比、最大操作距离等方面的限制。
